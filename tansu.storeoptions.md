|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [equal?](./tansu.storeoptions.equal.md) |  | (a: T, b: T) =&gt; boolean | _(Optional)_ Custom function to compare two values, that should return true if they are equal. It is called when setting a new value to avoid doing anything (such as notifying subscribers) if the value did not change. The default logic (when this option is not present) is to return false if <code>a</code> is a function or an object, or if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are different according to <code>Object.is</code>. |
