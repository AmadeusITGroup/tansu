## Store.notEqual() method

Compares two values and returns true if they are different. It is called when setting a new value to avoid doing anything (such as notifying subscribers) if the value did not change. The default logic is to return true if `a` is a function or an object, or if `a` and `b` are different according to `Object.is`<!-- -->. This method can be overridden by subclasses to change the logic.

**Signature:**

```typescript
protected notEqual(a: T, b: T): boolean;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  a | T | First value to compare. |
|  b | T | Second value to compare. |

**Returns:**

boolean

true if a and b are considered different.
