## StoreOptions.notEqual property

Custom function to compare two values, that should return true if they are different. It is called when setting a new value to avoid doing anything (such as notifying subscribers) if the value did not change. The default logic (when this option is not present) is to return true if `a` is a function or an object, or if `a` and `b` are different according to `Object.is`<!-- -->.

**Signature:**

```typescript
notEqual?: (a: T, b: T) => boolean;
```
